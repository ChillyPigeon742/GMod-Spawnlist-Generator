# GMod Spawnlist Generator

A simple tool for generating model-based spawnlists for **Garry's Mod**.

## Requirements

Before using this tool, make sure you have the following:

- A **16x16 icon**  
  GMod provides many of these by default, which can be found in:  
  `VPK/resource/icon16/`  
  If you're using your own custom icon, make sure it is **16x16** and mounted properly in the game's `resource` folder so it can be accessed in-game.

- The **models you want to use**  
  These should be:
  - Mounted in-game  
  - Extracted elsewhere so they can be input into the program
