# GMod-Spawnlist-Generator

A simple tool made for generating model-based spawnlists for Garry's Mod  
  
What you need to have:  
--A 16x16 icon (GMod provides lots of these already in game in resource/icon16)
--The models you want to use mounted in game and extracted else where to input into the program
