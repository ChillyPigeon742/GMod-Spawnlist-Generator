# GMod Spawnlist Generator

A simple utility for generating model-based spawnlists for **Garry's Mod**.

## Requirements

Before using this tool, ensure you have the following:

### A 16x16 Icon

GMod provides many built-in icons, found in:

`VPK/resource/icon16/`

If you're using a custom icon:

- It **must be 16x16**
- It should be **mounted properly** in the game's `resource/` directory
- You can put it in game via a **local addon**

### The Models You Want to Use

Make sure your models are:

- **Mounted in-game**
- **Extracted** to a location where they can be accessed and passed into the program
